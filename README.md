# Measuring Changes in Tumour Density

Given a series of [NIfTI](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/) images describing a tumour under treatment, measure changes in the tumour's [Hounsfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale) radiodensity as a function of time.

A screenshot of the result:

## How to run it:

```make install```

Third, run the tests:

Do all tests pass without error?

If yes, you can run the app (assuming you have patient data available):

```make run```

## Note
No patient data has been committed to this repository.
